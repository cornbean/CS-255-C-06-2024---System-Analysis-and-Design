# CS-255-C-06-2024---System-Analysis-and-Design


The client, DriverPass, wanted a system where users could register for driving classes online and then come take them in person with an instructor. They wanted the user to be able to register or edit any courses they signed up for. They also wanted the Admin users, the Owner and the IT Admin, to be able to have user maintenance access and to be able to generate reports so they can see the activity of the system. 

I was able to figure out what the client needed particularly well. Read the transcript and pinpoint what all the client wanted and be able to interpret that information with how I designed the system.

I would probably make my graphs/diagrams more thought out and easier to read. Some of them weren’t the best looking so going back and fixing them up would be best.

I interpreted the user’s needs by carefully reading what they were saying in the provided transcript, and relating that to haow the system would be designed. They talked about a user being able to cancel a course they signed up for, and knew they would need some form of button on the student user side to be able to do that. It’s important to consider the user’s needs as at the end of the day, that’s who you’re making the system for. If it goes against what they are wanting, then you’re just wasting everyone’s time. Don’t make changes on a whim because you think it would look better compared to what the client originally wanted. If you think a change in some regard is warranted, run it by the client first and get approval. Then make the change if they approve, if they don’t 
then stick with the original design. 

I definitely like using the graphs and diagrams like the UML diagrams. It makes it easy to get a rough idea on how the system will work without getting too much into the weeds and technicalities. It’s also easier to show a client who isn’t well versed in how any of the technicals work so they are able to understand the concepts better.
